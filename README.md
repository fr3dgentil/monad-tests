# Monad tests

Hi,
If you stumble on this, it's simply a test for me to get acquainted with Github.

The codes here come from the book [Functional Programming in JavaScript]
(https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-javascript) of 
[Luis Atencio](https://medium.com/@luijar).

Monads are nothing more than chainable expressions or chainable computations. 
This allows you to build sequences that apply additional processing at each 
step—like a conveyor belt in an assembly line. But chaining operations isn’t the 
only modality where monads are used. Using monadic containers as return types 
creates consistent, type-safe return values for functions and preserves 
referential transpar- ency. Recall from chapter 4 that this satisfies the 
requirement for composing func- tion chains and compositions.
